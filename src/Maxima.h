/*! Interface to the Maxima process
 *
 * Eventually this class will be the entire stand-alone Maxima
 * interface, factored out from wxMaxima. For now, it only provides
 * socket I/O.
 *
 * It is a source of EVT_MAXIMA events, used to asynchronously
 * decouple the I/O from the front-end. In the future, more of this class
 * could run on a worker thread perhaps.
 *
 * What it already does do is that on incoming data it creates a worker
 * thread that splits the incoming data into known XML tags maxima sends
 * and misc text and sends each of these items in a separate
 * EVT_MAXIMA to the wxMaxima main class

    This is a restartable process that is meant to be run as a background thread
    that interprets the data maxima has sent us and sends it to wxMaxima one
    item at a time.

    Items that this task recognizes:
     - All XML tags registered in m_knownTags are sent as a whole before
       sending them to wxMaxima and in most cases this background task even
       parses the XML data beforehand.
     - All text between such commands is left as it is and sent to wxMaxima
       as a string.
     .

    If m_abortParserThread = true this process exits as fast as possible in
    order to allow the main thread to append data to m_socketInputData, as fast
    as possible: If maxima hasn't finished sending data it is highly probable
    that m_socketInputData will contain the beginning of an XML tag, but not
    its end and therefore cannot do anything, anyway.

    the signal that data is available and long after the idle event. Hopefully the
